# MeTTa-Powered Intelligent Task Scheduling System

## Overview

This smart task scheduler uses **MeTTa (Meta Type Talk)**, a functional programming language for knowledge representation and reasoning, to implement sophisticated scheduling algorithms that go beyond simple chronological ordering. The system combines logical reasoning with real-time optimization to automatically schedule tasks based on multiple factors including urgency, dependencies, deadlines, and context switching minimization.

## What is MeTTa?

MeTTa is a hypergraph rewriting language that excels at:
- **Knowledge Representation**: Expressing complex relationships and rules
- **Symbolic Reasoning**: Making logical deductions based on facts and rules
- **Pattern Matching**: Finding optimal solutions through rule-based inference
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjusting behavior based on changing conditions

## Core MeTTa Scheduling Components

### 1. Task Representation and Priority Levels

```metta
;; Define task representation
(: task (-> String String String String String Number Number String String))

;; Define priority levels
(= (priority-level 1) low)
(= (priority-level 2) medium)
(= (priority-level 3) high)
(= (priority-level 4) urgent)
(= (priority-level 5) critical)
```

**Functionality**: 
- Tasks are represented as structured data with multiple attributes
- Priority levels are mapped to semantic meanings for better reasoning
- This allows MeTTa to make intelligent decisions based on task urgency

### 2. Optimal Time Slot Allocation

```metta
;; Define optimal time slots based on urgency and priority
(: optimal-time-slot (-> Number Number String))
(= (optimal-time-slot $urgency $priority)
   (if (> $urgency 0.8) "early-morning"    ;; 9:00 AM for critical
       (if (> $urgency 0.6) "morning"      ;; 10:00 AM for urgent
           (if (> $urgency 0.4) "midday"   ;; 12:00 PM for medium
               "afternoon"))))              ;; 2:00 PM for low priority
```

**How it works**:
- **Critical tasks (urgency > 0.8)**: Scheduled for early morning (9:00 AM) when focus is highest
- **Urgent tasks (urgency > 0.6)**: Morning slots (10:00 AM) for good productivity
- **Medium tasks (urgency > 0.4)**: Midday scheduling (12:00 PM) for steady progress
- **Low priority tasks**: Afternoon slots (2:00 PM) when energy naturally dips

### 3. Advanced Time Optimization Rules

```metta
;; MeTTa Time Optimization Rules
(: metta-optimal-start-time (-> String Number Number String))
(= (metta-optimal-start-time $task-id $urgency $duration)
   (let* (($preferred-slot (optimal-time-slot $urgency (task-priority $task-id)))
          ($available-gap (find-time-gap $preferred-slot $duration)))
     (if (= $available-gap none)
         (find-next-available-slot $duration)
         $available-gap)))
```

**Functionality**:
- Combines urgency with available time gaps
- First tries to place tasks in their optimal time slots
- Falls back to next available slot if preferred time is occupied
- Considers task duration when finding suitable gaps

### 4. Gap-Based Scheduling Optimization

```metta
;; Gap-based scheduling optimization
(: find-optimal-gap (-> Number List String))
(= (find-optimal-gap $duration $existing-slots)
   (filter-gaps-by-size $duration (calculate-gaps $existing-slots)))

;; Calculate gaps between scheduled tasks
(: calculate-gaps (-> List List))
(= (calculate-gaps $scheduled-slots)
   (sort-by-start-time 
    (map (lambda ($slot) (gap-between-tasks $slot)) $scheduled-slots)))
```

**How it works**:
1. **Gap Analysis**: Identifies empty time slots between scheduled tasks
2. **Size Filtering**: Only considers gaps large enough for the task duration
3. **Optimal Placement**: Minimizes schedule fragmentation by filling gaps efficiently
4. **Continuous Optimization**: Sorts and analyzes gaps for best fit

### 5. Urgency-Based Time Compression

```metta
;; MeTTa Urgency-based Time Compression
(: compress-schedule-for-urgency (-> String Number))
(= (compress-schedule-for-urgency $task-id $urgency)
   (if (> $urgency 0.9)
       (enable-extended-hours $task-id)    ;; Allow work beyond normal hours
       (if (> $urgency 0.7)
           (reduce-buffer-time $task-id)   ;; Minimize gaps between tasks
           (standard-scheduling $task-id))))
```

**Functionality**:
- **Critical urgency (> 0.9)**: Extends working hours beyond normal schedule
- **High urgency (> 0.7)**: Reduces buffer time between tasks for tighter scheduling
- **Normal urgency**: Uses standard scheduling with adequate buffer time

### 6. Dynamic Deadline Pressure Management

```metta
;; Dynamic schedule readjustment when deadlines approach
(: metta-deadline-pressure (-> String String Number))
(= (metta-deadline-pressure $task-id $deadline $current-time)
   (let* (($time-remaining (- $deadline $current-time))
          ($pressure-score (/ 1 (+ 1 $time-remaining))))
     (if (> $pressure-score 0.8)
         (emergency-reschedule $task-id)
         (if (> $pressure-score 0.5)
             (priority-boost $task-id)
             (normal-schedule $task-id)))))
```

**How it works**:
1. **Pressure Calculation**: Inversely proportional to time remaining
2. **Emergency Mode (pressure > 0.8)**: Triggers complete reschedule prioritizing urgent task
3. **Priority Boost (pressure > 0.5)**: Elevates task priority without full reschedule
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Pressure recalculated as deadlines approach

### 7. Conflict Resolution Logic

```metta
;; Conflict resolution using MeTTa logic
(: resolve-time-conflict (-> String String String))
(= (resolve-time-conflict $task1-id $task2-id)
   (let* (($urgency1 (calculate-urgency $task1-id))
          ($urgency2 (calculate-urgency $task2-id)))
     (if (> $urgency1 $urgency2)
         (bump-task $task2-id $task1-id)
         (bump-task $task1-id $task2-id))))
```

**Functionality**:
- Compares urgency scores of conflicting tasks
- Higher urgency task takes priority in time slot
- Lower urgency task gets "bumped" to next available slot
- Ensures fair allocation based on calculated importance

### 8. Automatic Readjustment Triggers

```metta
;; Automatic readjustment triggers
(: metta-readjust-trigger (-> String String))
(= (metta-readjust-trigger "high-priority-added" $user-id)
   (compress-low-priority-tasks $user-id))

(= (metta-readjust-trigger "deadline-approaching" $task-id)
   (emergency-time-allocation $task-id))

(= (metta-readjust-trigger "dependency-completed" $task-id)
   (immediate-schedule-dependents $task-id))
```

**Trigger Events**:
- **High-Priority Task Added**: Compresses low-priority tasks to make room
- **Deadline Approaching**: Allocates emergency time slots
- **Dependency Completed**: Immediately schedules dependent tasks

### 9. Context Switching Minimization

```metta
;; Context-switching minimization
(: minimize-context-switching (-> List List))
(= (minimize-context-switching $tasks)
   (group-by-category 
    (sort-by-similarity $tasks)))

;; Energy and focus optimization
(: energy-based-scheduling (-> String String String))
(= (energy-based-scheduling $task-type $time-of-day)
   (if (= $task-type "creative")
       (prefer-morning-hours)
       (if (= $task-type "analytical")
           (prefer-focused-blocks)
           (flexible-timing))))
```

**Optimization Strategy**:
- **Task Grouping**: Similar tasks scheduled consecutively
- **Energy Alignment**: Creative work in morning, analytical work in focus blocks
- **Reduced Switching**: Minimizes cognitive overhead of changing task types

### 10. Proportional Time Allocation for Competing Deadlines

```metta
;; Proportional Time Allocation for Competing Deadlines
(: proportional-time-allocation (-> List Number List))
(= (proportional-time-allocation $tasks $available-time)
   (let* (($total-required (sum-task-durations $tasks))
          ($allocation-factor (/ $available-time $total-required)))
     (map (lambda ($task) 
       (allocate-proportional-time $task $allocation-factor)) $tasks)))
```

**Fair Scheduling Logic**:
- When multiple tasks compete for limited time before shared deadlines
- Each task receives time proportional to its estimated duration
- Formula: `(task_duration / total_required_duration) * available_time`
- Ensures fair distribution when resources are constrained

### 11. Dependency-Aware Scheduling

```metta
;; Define dependency relationships
(: depends-on (-> String String))
(: independent-task (-> String))
(: task-overdue (-> String Bool))

;; Rule: Dependent tasks can be scheduled if immediate dependency is completed OR overdue
(= (can-schedule $task-id)
   (and (depends-on $task-id $dependency-id)
        (or (task-completed $dependency-id)
            (task-overdue $dependency-id))))
```

**Dependency Logic**:
- **Independent Tasks**: Can be scheduled immediately
- **Dependent Tasks**: Require completion of immediate dependency
- **Overdue Dependencies**: Don't block dependent tasks (allows progress)
- **No Recursive Checking**: Only validates immediate dependencies for efficiency

## Integration with Python Scheduler

### 1. Urgency Score Calculation

The Python scheduler implements MeTTa's urgency calculation:

```python
def calculate_urgency_score(self, task: Task) -> float:
    """Calculate urgency score based on deadline and priority"""
    deadline_urgency = 1 / (1 + time_until_deadline / 24)  # Normalized by days
    priority_urgency = task.priority / 5.0
    
    # Combined using MeTTa weights
    urgency_score = (deadline_urgency * self.deadline_weight + 
                    priority_urgency * self.priority_weight)
    return urgency_score
```

### 2. MeTTa-Based Optimal Time Finding

```python
def find_optimal_start_time_with_metta(self, task: Task, user_tasks: List[Task]) -> datetime:
    """Find optimal start time using MeTTa logic"""
    urgency_score = self.calculate_urgency_score(task)
    
    # MeTTa Logic: Urgency-based time preference
    if urgency_score > 0.7:    # High urgency
        preferred_start_hour = 9   # Early morning
    elif urgency_score > 0.4:  # Medium urgency  
        preferred_start_hour = 10  # Standard morning
    else:                      # Low urgency
        preferred_start_hour = 14  # Afternoon
```

### 3. Real-Time Schedule Optimization

```python
def schedule_all_user_tasks_sequential(self, user_id: str) -> Dict[str, Dict]:
    """Schedule with MeTTa-based optimization"""
    schedulable_tasks = self.get_schedulable_tasks(user_id)
    sorted_tasks = self.sort_tasks_by_urgency(schedulable_tasks)
    
    # Group by deadline proximity for proportional allocation
    deadline_groups = self.group_tasks_by_deadline_proximity(sorted_tasks)
    
    for deadline_group in deadline_groups:
        if self.needs_proportional_allocation(deadline_group):
            # Apply MeTTa proportional allocation rules
            self.allocate_time_proportionally(deadline_group)
```
