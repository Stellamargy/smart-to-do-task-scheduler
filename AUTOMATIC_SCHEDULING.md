# Automatic Task Scheduling

## Overview

The task scheduler has been modified to automatically schedule tasks without manual user intervention. Tasks are now automatically reorganized whenever there are changes to the task database.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Removed Manual Scheduling Endpoints**:
   - `/tasks/schedule` - Manual schedule all tasks
   - `/tasks/<task_id>/reschedule` - Manual reschedule specific task

2. **Added Automatic Scheduling**:
   - Tasks are automatically scheduled when created
   - Tasks are automatically rescheduled when updated (priority, deadline, duration, dependency)
   - Tasks are automatically rescheduled when completed (enables dependent tasks)
   - Tasks are automatically rescheduled when deleted

3. **Updated Task Model**:
   - Modified `save()` method to trigger automatic scheduling
   - Added scheduling flag to prevent infinite loops
   - Scheduling runs in background thread to avoid blocking

4. **Updated TaskScheduler Service**:
   - Added `auto_schedule_on_task_change()` method
   - Automatic priority-based reorganization
   - High priority tasks reorganize the entire schedule

### Frontend Changes

1. **Removed Manual Scheduling UI**:
   - Removed schedule buttons and controls
   - Removed reschedule task options
   - Removed scheduling weight configuration

2. **Updated Services**:
   - Removed `scheduleAllTasks()` and `rescheduleTask()` methods
   - Removed scheduling-related types and interfaces

3. **Updated Components**:
   - TaskList no longer shows reschedule options
   - Dashboard removed scheduling controls
   - Simplified task management interface

### MeTTa Knowledge Base Changes

1. **Updated Scheduler Logic**:
   - Added automatic scheduling triggers
   - Priority-based automatic reorganization
   - Real-time scheduling optimization
   - Dependency chain automatic rescheduling

## How It Works

1. **Task Creation**: When a user creates a task, it automatically triggers a complete reschedule of all user tasks based on priority and deadlines.

2. **Task Updates**: Any changes to task properties (priority, deadline, duration, dependencies) automatically trigger rescheduling.

3. **Task Completion**: Marking a task as complete automatically enables and schedules any dependent tasks.

4. **High Priority Tasks**: When a high priority task (4-5) is added, it can bump lower priority tasks to optimize the schedule.

5. **Dependency Management**: When dependencies are completed, dependent tasks are automatically scheduled in the optimal time slots.

## Benefits

- **No Manual Intervention**: Users don't need to remember to schedule tasks
- **Dynamic Optimization**: Schedule automatically adapts to changes
- **Priority-Aware**: High priority tasks automatically reorganize schedules
- **Dependency-Aware**: Completing tasks automatically enables dependent tasks
- **Real-time Updates**: Schedule is always current and optimized

## User Experience

- Users simply create, update, and complete tasks
- Schedule is automatically maintained and optimized
- High priority tasks automatically get precedence
- No need to manually trigger scheduling operations
- Tasks are always scheduled optimally based on current constraints
